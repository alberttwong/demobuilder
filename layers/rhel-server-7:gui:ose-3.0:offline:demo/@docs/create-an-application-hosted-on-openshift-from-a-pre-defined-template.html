## Create an application hosted on OpenShift from a pre-defined template

These steps demonstrate how OpenShift can build and deploy a (possibly
multi-component) traditional or modern application from a pre-defined template.
This might be done by a developer, tester or operator to quickly set up a
dedicated application instance according to its template, using OpenShift's
self-service portal.

1. **IMPORTANT**: in the *Projects* list, select the *demo* project.  You must
   use the *demo* project at this point for the rest of the walk-through to
   proceed!
1. Click the *Add to Project* button.
1. Under *Instant Apps*, click *monster*.
1. Scroll down and click *Create*.
1. Wait for the example application to be cloned, built and deployed.  It will
   take up to a minute or two for the build process to begin automatically and
   then complete.
1. Optional: use the command `oc build-logs monster-1` to follow the build
   process.
1. `CTRL`-click the application URL
   (*http://monster-demo.apps.example.com*) to launch the application in a new
   tab.
   
** Note: When you create a project, it make take a while for the imagesteam process to kick off.  Factor that time in as part of the demo.

** Note: When the POD is now running/green, it may take some time for JBoss EAP to start up within the pod.
